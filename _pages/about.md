Hi! This is Chen Chen (陈晨). I am currently a senior research scientist at NVIDIA. 

Prior to this, I received my PhD from Nanyang Technological University in 2025, luckily advised by Prof. [Chng Eng-Siong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FJodrCcAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests include: 
- **Auditory LLMs**: Full-duplex Spoken Dialogue System, Audio-text Foundation Models.
- **Speech Processing**: Speech Recognition / Separation / Enhancement, Text-to-Speech Synthesis.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: RLHF Alignment, RL in Robotics.

I have some [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uUmSp1QAAAAJ) on these topics. I also enjoy contributing back to the academic community by reviewing main AI conferences or serving as Area Chair (e.g., ICLR). Additionally, feel free to reach out if you're interested in discussing potential collaborations.
