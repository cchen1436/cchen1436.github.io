Hi! This is Chen Chen (陈晨). I am currently a senior research scientist at NVIDIA. 

Prior to this, I received my PhD from Nanyang Technological University in 2025, luckily advised by Prof. [Chng Eng-Siong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FJodrCcAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research topics are: 
- **Auditory LLMs**: Full-duplex Spoken Dialogue System, Audio-text Foundation Models.
- **Speech Processing**: Speech Recognition / Separation / Enhancement, Text-to-Speech Synthesis.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: RLHF Alignment, RL in Robotics.

I have some [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uUmSp1QAAAAJ) in main AI conferences and actively contribute to the academic community by serving as a reviewer and Area Chair (ICLR). Additionally, feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating or discussing these topics.
