Hi! This is Chen Chen (陈晨). I am currently a senior research scientist at NVIDIA. 

Prior to this, I received my PhD from Nanyang Technological University in 2025, luckily advised by Prof. [Chng Eng-Siong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FJodrCcAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests include: 
- **Auditory LLMs**: Full-duplex Spoken Dialogue System, Audio-text Foundation Models.
- **Speech Processing**: Speech Recognition / Separation / Enhancement, Text-to-Speech Synthesis.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: RLHF Alignment, RL in Robotics.

I have some related [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uUmSp1QAAAAJ) based on these topics. I also enjoy contributing back to the academic community by reviewing AI conference papers or serving as a Area Chair (e.g., ICLR). Additionally, feel free to reach out if you're interested in discussing potential collaborations.
